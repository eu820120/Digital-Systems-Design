# Digital-Systems-Design
A Digital System Design course consisting of 5 labs and a final project. SystemVerilog, VHDL, Assembly and a De1-soc FPGA were used for these projects.

# Lab 1 Tone organ
Using a frequency divider, we generated "523Hz 587Hz 659Hz 698Hz 783Hz 880Hz 987Hz 1046Hz" signals from the 50MHz clock. The generated frequency is controllable from the switches SW[3:1], SW[0] enables the audio output. A LED control was also done to have LEDs flashing from side to side.

# Lab 2 Simple Ipod
An MP3 was made using the De1-soc with a Altera flash controller and a keyboard for audio control.
